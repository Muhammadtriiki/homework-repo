        "# Number Guessing Game - Code Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Imports and Setup\n",
        "- The game uses Python's `random` module for generating random numbers\n",
        "- All functionality is organized into separate functions for better code structure\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Core Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1 `generate_random_number(difficulty)`\n",
        "- Generates a random number based on difficulty level\n",
        "- Uses a dictionary to store ranges for each difficulty:\n",
        "  - Easy: 1-50\n",
        "  - Medium: 1-100\n",
        "  - Hard: 1-200\n",
        "- Returns a random number within the selected range\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 `get_player_info()`\n",
        "- Simple function to collect player's name\n",
        "- Uses strip() to remove any extra whitespace\n",
        "- Returns the player's name as a string\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.3 `get_difficulty_choice()`\n",
        "- Displays difficulty options to player\n",
        "- Shows number ranges and attempts for each level\n",
        "- Validates input to ensure it's 1, 2, or 3\n",
        "- Uses a dictionary to convert numeric choice to difficulty string\n",
        "- Returns difficulty as \"easy\", \"medium\", or \"hard\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.4 `get_player_guess(attempts_left)`\n",
        "- Handles player guess input\n",
        "- Shows remaining attempts\n",
        "- Validates input to ensure it's a valid number\n",
        "- Uses try/except to handle non-numeric inputs\n",
        "- Returns the player's guess as an integer\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.5 `check_guess(guess, target)`\n",
        "- Compares player's guess with target number\n",
        "- Provides feedback: \"Too high\" or \"Too low\"\n",
        "- Returns True if guess is correct, False otherwise\n",
        "- Displays success message on correct guess\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.6 `manage_score(attempts, max_attempts)`\n",
        "- Calculates player's score based on attempts used\n",
        "- Score = maximum attempts - attempts used\n",
        "- Higher scores for fewer attempts used\n",
        "- Displays the final score to the player\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.7 `play_again()`\n",
        "- Asks if player wants another game\n",
        "- Accepts various forms of yes/no input\n",
        "- Validates input to ensure valid response\n",
        "- Returns True for yes, False for no\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.8 `main_game_loop()`\n",
        "- Controls the overall game flow\n",
        "- Sets up initial game state\n",
        "- Manages attempts and game rounds\n",
        "- Handles difficulty selection and game progression\n",
        "- Contains the core game logic\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Game Features\n",
        "- Three difficulty levels with different ranges and attempts:\n",
        "  - Easy: 1-50 (10 attempts)\n",
        "  - Medium: 1-100 (7 attempts)\n",
        "  - Hard: 1-200 (5 attempts)\n",
        "- Score system based on remaining attempts\n",
        "- Input validation throughout\n",
        "- Friendly user interface with clear instructions\n",
        "- Replay option after each game\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Game Flow\n",
        "1. Welcome message and player name collection\n",
        "2. Difficulty selection\n",
        "3. Random number generation\n",
        "4. Guessing loop with feedback\n",
        "5. Score calculation\n",
        "6. Play again option\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Error Handling\n",
        "- Input validation for all user inputs\n",
        "- Try/except blocks for numeric inputs\n",
        "- Clear error messages for invalid inputs\n",
        "- Graceful handling of unexpected inputs\n",
        "\n",
        "This code demonstrates good programming practices:\n",
        "- Clear function documentation\n",
        "- Modular design\n",
        "- Input validation\n",
        "- Error handling\n",
        "- User-friendly interface\n",
        "- Maintainable structure"
