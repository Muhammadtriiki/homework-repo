        "The game consists of several key functions that work together:\n",
        "\n",
        "player_information():\n",
        "This function handles the initial player interaction. It asks for the player's name and makes sure it's not empty. Once it has a valid name, it welcomes the player and asks them to think of a number.\n",
        "\n",
        "make_guess():\n",
        "This function generates the computer's guesses. It works in two ways:\n",
        "- For an unlimited range (when max_value is infinity), it adds a random number between 1 and 1000 to the minimum value\n",
        "- For a limited range, it picks a random number between the minimum and maximum values\n",
        "The function includes error handling to ensure it always returns a valid guess.\n",
        "\n",
        "get_user_feedback():\n",
        "This handles player responses after each guess. Players can indicate if the guess is:\n",
        "- Too high (using \"high\" or \"h\")\n",
        "- Too low (using \"low\" or \"l\")\n",
        "- Correct (using \"correct\" or \"c\")\n",
        "The function validates input to ensure only these responses are accepted.\n",
        "\n",
        "update_guess_range():\n",
        "This function refines the guessing range based on player feedback:\n",
        "- If the guess was too high, it sets the new maximum value to (guess - 1)\n",
        "- If the guess was too low, it sets the new minimum value to (guess + 1)\n",
        "It includes logic checks to catch contradictory feedback from the player.\n",
        "\n",
        "play_again():\n",
        "This function asks if the player wants another round. It accepts \"yes\"/\"y\" or \"no\"/\"n\" as valid responses and returns a boolean value.\n",
        "\n",
        "main():\n",
        "This is the game's core loop that:\n",
        "1. Gets the player's name\n",
        "2. Starts with an infinite maximum range\n",
        "3. Makes guesses and updates the range based on feedback\n",
        "4. Handles special cases like:\n",
        "   - When min_value equals max_value (only one possible number left)\n",
        "   - When feedback creates an invalid range (contradictory inputs)\n",
        "5. Offers to play again after each game\n",
        "6. Includes comprehensive error handling to maintain game stability\n",
        "\n",
        "The code uses error handling throughout to ensure a smooth player experience, catching and handling various types of errors that might occur during gameplay. This includes input validation, logical error checking, and graceful error recovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "The game provides clear feedback at each step and maintains the game state even if errors occur, making it both user-friendly and robust."
