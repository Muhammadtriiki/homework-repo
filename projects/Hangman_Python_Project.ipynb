        "\n",
        "1. The code starts with three main classes:\n",
        "   - `WordManager`: Handles word categories and difficulty levels\n",
        "   - `GameState`: Manages the current game state\n",
        "   - `Player`: Stores player information and statistics\n",
        "\n",
        "2. WordManager Class Details:\n",
        "   - Contains predefined categories (animals, countries, games, movies)\n",
        "   - Has three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)\n",
        "   - Loads words from corresponding text files based on category and difficulty\n",
        "   - Uses a dictionary structure to map category/difficulty to specific files\n",
        "\n",
        "3. GameState Class Details:\n",
        "   - Tracks the current word being guessed\n",
        "   - Maintains a set of guessed letters\n",
        "   - Keeps count of total and remaining attempts\n",
        "   - Has a flag for game activity status\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Player Class Details:\n",
        "   - Stores player's name\n",
        "   - Maintains profile with games played, wins, and losses\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Helper Functions:\n",
        "   - `get_valid_input`: Ensures user inputs are valid\n",
        "   - `initialize_game`: Sets up initial game configuration\n",
        "   - `display_interface`: Shows current game status\n",
        "   - `handle_guess`: Processes player's letter guesses\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Main Game Logic (play_game function):\n",
        "   - Gets a random word based on category and difficulty\n",
        "   - Maintains the game loop until win or loss\n",
        "   - Shows word with underscores for unguessed letters\n",
        "   - Validates user input for single letters\n",
        "   - Updates game state based on guesses\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Main Function Flow:\n",
        "   - Initializes player and game settings\n",
        "   - Runs continuous game loop until player chooses to quit\n",
        "   - Displays final statistics when done\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Game Features:\n",
        "   - Multiple categories of words\n",
        "   - Different difficulty levels\n",
        "   - Player statistics tracking\n",
        "   - Input validation\n",
        "   - Configurable number of attempts\n",
        "   - File-based word storage\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Program Execution:\n",
        "   - Starts when run directly (not imported)\n",
        "   - Handles file-not-found errors gracefully\n",
        "   - Provides continuous gameplay option\n",
        "\n",
        "10. User Interface:\n",
        "    - Clear display of game progress\n",
        "    - Shows guessed letters\n",
        "    - Displays remaining attempts\n",
        "    - Provides feedback for each guess"
