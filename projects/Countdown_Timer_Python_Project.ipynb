        "- **Input Prompt:** The user is prompted to enter a time in the `HH:MM:SS` format or type `exit` to quit.\n",
        "- **Exit Condition:** If the user types `exit`, the program prints a message and stops execution.\n",
        "- **Time Validation:**\n",

        "  - The remaining time is printed in `HH:MM:SS` format.\n",
        "  - The program waits for 1 second using `time.sleep(1)` before updating the time.\n",

        "This is the main function that controls the overall flow of the program. It brings together the other functions to create the countdown timer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps:**\n",
